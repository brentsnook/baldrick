- Fill out all missing information in files generated by newgem

- Github description

  - Baldrick - a dogsbody

- Final test run

- Publish to rubyforge









- Documentation on wiki

  - How does it work?

    You tell Baldrick how to perform tasks and which tasks will be performed when a particular order is received. Baldrick keeps an ear out at the places you tell it to listen and then does its thing. Quite simple really.

  - What is it good for
    - Controlling a continuous integration build light (link to Delcom)
    - Collating data on injour messages
    - Controlling a nuclear power plant
    
  - How do I use it?
    - Creating a configuration file
      - Telling baldrick where to listen for orders
        - Injour
        - RSS (including server)
      - Telling baldrick how to follow orders
        - orders - who, what, when, where
        - pattern matching - match on what and make matching groups available as parameters
      
  - Other Listeners Planned
    - Twitter
    - Email 
- Turnip logo

- need a way to prevent InjourListener from constantly eating memory because of processed orders being stored (record latest message for a user?)
