  - How does it work?

    You tell Baldrick how to perform tasks and which tasks will be performed when a particular order is received. Baldrick keeps an ear out at the places you tell it to listen and then does its thing. Quite simple really.

  - What is it good for
    - Doing funky stuff based on [injour] statuses
    - Doing funky stuff based on RSS/Atom feeds
    - Controlling a continuous integration build light (link to Delcom)
    - Controlling a nuclear power plant
    
  - How do I use it?
    - Creating a configuration file
      - Telling baldrick where to listen for orders
        - Injour
        - RSS (including server)
          - let me know if your case isnt covered for author etc or fork me
      - Telling baldrick how to follow orders
        - orders - who, what, when, where
        - pattern matching - match on what and make matching groups available as parameters
      
  - Other Listeners Planned
    - Twitter
    - Email 

- add ability to pass in feed listener xpath expressions for who, what, where, when during configuration
- fix bug: displaying multiple stack traces after error
- better way to log error with listener than puts
